Distributed systems approach to airborne viruses

### Breathing

What happens when you breathe? Air is moving in and out of your lungs as a result of a pressure gradient. You can control this pressure gradient with your mind. If you lower your diaphragm, you will expand your lungs—leading to a lower density of air particles in your lungs, creating negative pressure, thus inviting the atmosphere inside of you. We call this process *inhalation*.

Conversely, raising your diaphragm will contract your lungs and create more pressure, as all the air particles inside your lungs become tightly packed together and bounce off each other more. Then, the higher pressure within your lungs compared to the relatively lower pressure in the atmosphere, will naturally result in an *exhalation*.

Thirdly, it's possible for you to close your throat. What's happening here is that you're using a flap of muscle called the *epiglottis* to block the pathway to your windpipe, or *larynx*. This effectively isolates the container—your lungs—from the outside world, or atmosphere. If your epiglottis is healthy, it can work as a valve to prevent the flow of air in or out of your lungs, without too much concern for the state of the pressure gradient. This is called *holding your breath*.

### Viruses

#### Central Dogma

To explain viruses, we first introduce the *Central Dogma of Molecular Biology*. This dogma relates three essential biological concepts: *DNA*, *RNA* and *proteins*.

##### DNA

DNA is a genetic code that contains information about various processes of life in your body. Because each cell in your body only has one copy of your DNA, there's a process for copying your DNA sequences, or genes, into RNA sequences, and then replicating that RNA many times over.

##### RNA

Now that there are many copies of the same RNA sequence, those copies can themselves be used many times over, simultaneously, effectively increasing the *bandwidth* for the encoded message within the sequence, and eliminating *bottlenecks* that would otherwise prevent their use.

##### Protein

Then, we *translate* these RNA sequences into proteins. Proteins, or enzymes, are little biological machines that go around performing all the processes of life inside your body. Translation is itself performed by protein machines that know how to interpret the genetic codes of an RNA sequence, and assemble together the right *amino acid* sequence necessary to make various kinds of protein machines needed for the processes of life. The newly synthesized chains of amino acids then fold themselves into the right shape according to the laws of nature.

#### Hijack

Viruses work by hijacking the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology. An example viral particle might consist of an RNA sequence, wrapped in a protective coating *membrane*, with an *injector* that is designed to attach to a *receptor*. Receptors are a type of protein that sits within your cell membranes, and they wait to receive particles of a certain shape on the outside of the membrane.

You may appreciate that if these vulnerable cells are in your lungs, for example, there is some probability that you will inhale a number of viral particles. Then there is some chance that one, or some, of these particles will bounce around inside your lungs and may successfully orient and attach themselves to your vulnerable receptors. At this point, the virus will inject its RNA sequence inside your cell, by hijacking the receptor.

Now, suddenly, there is a foreign RNA sequence inside one of your cells. Cells do not necessarily have a direct way to determine if the RNA sequences floating within them are *foreign* (possibly enemy) or *domestic* (likely friendly). Thus the mechanisms responsible for translating RNA sequences into protein machines will simply blindly do so, for both your own RNA, that was originally copied from your DNA, and for foreign RNA, sourced from the virus.

Your fundamental cellular hardware has been hijacked, and is now a factory for producing all the proteins of the virus that are encoded in its RNA. This includes all the components of the viral particles—protective coating membrane, injector, and of course, the RNA sequence. They then assemble themselves into individual viral particles, according to the laws of nature.

#### Damage

Many viral particles are now forming inside your cell, to the point where it starts to get full. At some point, the cell will become overstretched, and burst open, in a process known as *lysing*. Now there are viral particles floating about all over the place inside your lungs, possibly attaching to other vulnerable receptors, and repeating the same process, exponentially, *ad nauseum*.

Cells make up tissues, and tissues are organized into organs (ears, eyes, nose, throat, heart, liver, lungs, skin, etc). If you damage enough of your cells–tissues–organs, the processes of life will no longer be able to sustain themselves. You die.

#### Spread

You have various immune mechanisms for dealing with invading foreign particles. The most relevant mechanism in this case is coughing. The lungs determine that they have a source of irritation, and seek to expel it. This results in a cough—a rapid exhalation mediated by the valve of the epiglottis. If the foreign particles are relatively benign, e.g. pollen or some other allergen, all is well. However, if you have the unfortunate fate of being infected with a virus, the cough mechanism will be hijacked by the viral particles to increase their spread. There are now viral particles all around you, being potentially breathed in by those close to you, landing on surfaces, etc.

You may now appreciate that coughing is a special case of breathing. So of course, when you are breathing normally, you may be exhaling viral particles into the air if you are infected, even if you do not have a cough. Persons who are infected with the virus but do not have symptoms such as coughing are asymptomatic, but are still perfectly capable of spreading the virus.

### Application

Let's explore the implications for human behavior. When you are in a room, hallway or elevator, you are in an enclosed space, sharing the available atmosphere with the people around you. Anyone, including yourself, may be infected with an airborne virus and be unaware, due to a lack of symptoms. This is primetime for viral spread.

Take a breath before you enter the room, or elevator. When inside, you can hold your breath, or tend towards a gentle exhale. You will appreciate that it's near impossible to get infected unless you allow the atmosphere to flow into your lungs. Conversely, such a moment would be a bad time to exhale a large amount of air from your lungs, as you yourself may be unknowingly infected, and could potentially be ejecting viral particles into the atmosphere shared with the people around you.

On the other hand, when you are out and about and find yourself away from other people, you have a good opportunity to breathe. Minimize your breathing as you reach near other people. Or, if time allows, you can wait for the space to clear. Consider how the distance between you, and others, and your breathing, influence the risk of spreading infection.

You will find many different situations and encounters in which these principles will generally apply in your own life.

### Generality

We can synthetically extend our immune system by wearing masks, to further disrupt the flow of the rather large viral particles by hoping they will become entangled in the mask material, or not spread as broadly when we breathe. But even if you don't have your mask with you, even in the future when a new viral threat emerges, you can always wear the *mask of the mind*.
